# Departmental-Store-Project-C++

We have attempted to create a program which facilitates the customer as well as the owner’s needs in a Departmental Store by using data filing (file handling) in C++. The user can search and buy items while the owner can easily add or delete items from the inventory.  The program is designed using a binary file in such a way that a single program can be utilized to access the consumer side of the program and the owner side of the program.  The program can access multiple variables of a single item and can provide the consumer and the owner with a detailed summary of the product. A code is also assigned to the product for efficient searching and purchasing.
